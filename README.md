# DecisionDesk

Multiplatform meeting recorder: iOS (React Native), macOS (Electron+React), Web (React) + backend API.
- Offline-first clients (SQLite), chunked uploads, progress via WebSockets
- Transcription (Whisper) and AI summaries (GPT) with presets per folder/type
- Multi-tenant aware design and cost/budget tracking (roadmap)

This repo is seeded with **structure-only** files to guide tooling (Codex/Copilot). Implementations come later.
