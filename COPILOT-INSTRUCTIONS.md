- Follow MVP-first roadmap. Document public code (Javadoc/JSDoc).
- Do not hard-pin versions in seed; pick compatible, current versions.
- Conventional Commits + one changeset per PR.
- No duplicated utilitiesâ€”centralize in packages/utils.
- Dark mode default on clients; Tailwind (Web/Electron), NativeWind (RN).
- **Clients must never call OpenAI directly**; all Whisper/GPT happens in backend.
